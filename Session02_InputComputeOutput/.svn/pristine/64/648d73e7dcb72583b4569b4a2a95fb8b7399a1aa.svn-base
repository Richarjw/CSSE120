This module lets you practice:
  -- calling functions from the MATH and RANDOM modules
  -- capturing RETURNED VALUES in variables
  -- INPUT and OUTPUT

    Prompts for and gets (in the console, from the user)
    two floating-point numbers (using two input statements):
       an x-coordinate, then a y-coordinate.
    Prints the distance from that (x, y) to the origin (0, 0).

    Here is are TWO sample runs, where the user inputs
    are to the right of the colons:
       Enter an x-coordinate: 7.4
