This module uses ZELLEGRAPHICS to demonstrate:
  -- CONSTRUCTING objects,
  -- applying METHODS to them, and
  -- accessing their DATA via INSTANCE VARIABLES (aka FIELDS).

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Students: Read and run this program.
#
#           Also, WITH YOUR INSTRUCTOR, learn to use the DOT trick:
#               rg.           and rg.Circle().
#           to POP UP help from which you can learn how to use
#           objects of a class that you have never seen before.
#           (And the HOVER over a class or method to get its code.)
#
# There is nothing to turn in from this file.
# Just use it as an example to see and learn:
#   -- How to CONSTRUCT an object
#   -- How to APPLY A METHOD to an object (who_dot_doesWhat_withWhat)
#   -- How to ACCESS an INSTANCE VARIABLE of an object (who_dot_what)
#   -- the DOT andd HOVER pop-up tricks
