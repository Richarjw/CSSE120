      -- A positive floating point number
      -- A positive integer
      -- A string
    in that order (via three separate inputs).
    Then prints, in this order, all on separate lines:
      -- The square root of the floating point number,
         repeated the input integer number of times
      -- The string, repeated the input integer number of times.
    No input validation is required.  Nothing else should be printed.

    Here is a sample run, where the user input is to the right
    of the colons:
         Enter a positive floating point number: 1.44
         Enter a positive integer: 4
         Enter a string: Peace & Love.
