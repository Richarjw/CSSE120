    See   problem3a_picture.pdf   in this project for pictures that may
    help you better understand the following specification:

    1. Draws four rg.Circle's on the given rg.RoseWindow, as follows:

        a. The first rg.Circle is the given rg.Circle.

        b. The second rg.Circle is a new rg.Circle whose center
           is the same as the center of the given rg.Circle
           but whose radius is HALF the radius of the given rg.Circle.
           Also, this second rg.Circle has 'red' as its fill color.

        c. The third rg.Circle is a new rg.Circle that:
             -- has the same radius as the second (red) circle
             -- is immediately to the LEFT of, and barely touching,
                the second (red) circle, and
             -- has 'green' as its fill color.

        d. The fourth rg.Circle is a new rg.Circle that:
             -- has the same radius as the second (red) circle
             -- is immediately to the RIGHT of, and barely touching,
                the second (red) circle, and
             -- has 'blue' as its fill color.

    2. Waits for a mouse-click,
         with an appropriate message displayed to prompt the user.

    3. UN-draws all of the rg.Circle's just drawn,
       one at a time with a 2 second pause between each un-draw.

    Drawing the circles in the order listed ensures that the new ones
    are visible on top of the (larger) first one drawn.

    Preconditions:
        :type window: rg.RoseWindow
        :type circle: rg.Circle
      and the circle fits inside the window.
