# TODO:  Define here a class called   Point
#        that represents a point in two dimensions.
#        It has:
#   Instance variables:  x and y, for its two coordinates.
#   Methods:
#     __init__: Takes two optional arguments, x and y, both numbers.
#               Sets this Point's coordinates to the given x and y.
#               The defaults for x and y are 0.
#     __repr__: Returns a string that represents this Point
#               as in this example:  'Point(100, 32.7)'
#     move_to:  Takes two arguments, x and y, both numbers.
#               Sets this Point's x and y to those values.
#     move_by:  Takes two arguments, dx and dy, both numbers.
#               Increases this Point's x and y by those values.
#     distance_from:  Takes a Point and returns the distance
#                     that this Point is from the given Point.
#     closer_to:  Takes two Points p2 and p3.
#                 Returns whichever of p2 and p3 is closer
#                 to this Point.  (Returns p2 if they are tied).
#     halfway_to:  Takes a Point.
#                  Returns a new Point whose x coordinate is
#                  the average of the x-coordinates of this Point
#                  and the given Point, and whose y coordinate is
#                  the average of the y-coordinates of this Point
#                  and the given Point.
#
# Include appropriate docstrings with the methods that you define
# (copy-and-paste from the above makes it easy to do so).
# Test your class definition using the   m3_test_Point    module.
#   ** TEST EACH METHOD AS YOU DEFINE IT. **
