# TODO:  Define here a class called   Circle   that represents a circle.
#        It has:
#   Instance variables:
#     -- center (stored as a Point)
#     -- radius
#   Methods:
#     __init__: Takes two optional parameters, center and radius.
#               Sets this Circle's center and radius to the given values.
#               The defaults are a Point at (0, 0) and a radius of 1.
#     __repr__: Returns a string that represents this Circle
#               as in this example:
#                 'Circle(center = Point(100, 32.7), radius = 43)'
#     clone:    Returns a new Circle that is a copy of this Circle.
#     move_by:  Takes two arguments, dx and dy, both numbers.
#               Increases the x and y of this Circle's center
#               by dx and dy, respectively.
#     intersects:  Takes another Circle as an argument.
#                  Returns True if this Circle and the other Circle
#                  intersect, else returns False.  (If they barely
#                  touch, we will NOT call that an "intersection.")
#                    -- Hint: they intersect if the distance from their
#                       centers is less than the sum of their radii.
#     closer_to_origin: Takes another Circle as an argument.
#                       Returns this Circle or the other Circle,
#                       whichever one's center is closer to (0, 0).
#                       Breaks ties in favor of this Circle.
#     super_circle: Takes another Circle as an argument.
#                   Returns a new Circle that is the smallest Circle
#                   that contains both this Circle and the other Circle.
#
# Include appropriate docstrings with the methods that you define
# (copy-and-paste from the above makes it easy to do so).
# Test your class definition using the   m2_test_Circle    module.
#   ** TEST EACH METHOD AS YOU DEFINE IT. **
#
# Wherever reasonable, CALL methods previously defined rather than
# copying the code of those methods.

# imported by another module), then call the 'main' function.
