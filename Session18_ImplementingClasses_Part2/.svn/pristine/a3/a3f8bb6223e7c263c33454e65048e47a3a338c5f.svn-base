# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO:  Define here a class called   Rectangle   that represents a
#        rectangle whose sides are parallel to the x and y axes.
#        It has:
#   Instance variables:
#     -- corner1 (stored as a Point)
#     -- corner2 (stored as a Point)
#          where corner2 is the corner of the Rectangle opposite corner1
#        Do NOT assume that corner1 is any particular corner -- allow
#        for it to be any of the 4 possible corners.
#   Methods:
#     __init__: Takes two required parameters, corner1 and corner2,
#               both of which must be Point objects.
#               Sets this Rectangle's opposite corners
#               to the given points.
#     __repr__: Returns a string that represents this Circle
#               as in this example:
#                 'Rectangle(corners = Point(100, 32.7), Point(50, 90))'
#     clone:    Returns a new Rectangle that is a copy of this Rectangle.
#     move_by:  Takes two arguments, dx and dy, both numbers.
#               Moves this Rectangle by dx and dy, respectively.
#     corners:  Returns a list of the 4 Point objects that are corners
#               of this Rectangle.
#     contains: Takes a Point p.
#               Returns True if this Rectangle contains p,
#               else returns False.  We will say that the Rectangle
#               DOES contain p if p is on the Rectangle's border.
#     intersects:  Takes another Rectange as an argument.
#                  Returns True if this Rectangle and the other
#                  Rectangle intersect, else returns False.
#                    -- Hint: they intersect if one of the Rectangles
#                       contains at least one of the corners
#                       of the other Rectangle.
#     sub_circle:  Returns the largest Circle that fits inside
#                  this Rectangle and is centered within this Rectangle.
#     super_rectangle: Takes a list of Rectangles as an argument.
#                      Returns a new Rectangle that is the smallest
#                      Rectangle that contains all the Rectangles in
#                      the given list.
#
# Include appropriate docstrings with the methods that you define
# (copy-and-paste from the above makes it easy to do so).
# Test your class definition using the   m2_test_Rectangle    module.
#   ** TEST EACH METHOD AS YOU DEFINE IT. **
#
# Wherever reasonable, CALL methods previously defined rather than
# copying the code of those methods.
