# TODO: Do the following in STAGES, using ITERATIVE ENHANCEMENT.
#       That means that for each stage, you implement it, TEST it,
#       COMMIT your work WITH A SHORT, REASONABLE MESSAGE,
#       and then and only then continue to the next stage.
#
# Your ultimate goal for your part of this Practice Project is to have
# a correctly function button:
#   -- Go N centimeters
# plus two entry boxes in which the user can enter:
#   -- speed at which the robot is to move
#   -- centimeters the robot is to move
#
# Use the following ITERATIVE ENHANCEMENT PLAN, where each stage
# augments the preceding stages:
#
#   Stage 1: Frame appears with the button and Entry boxes on it.
#
#   Stage 2: Button prints a message, as a stub.
#              -- A STUB is placeholder code that lets you do some
#                 testing even before you have finished the real code.
#
#   Stage 3: Button prints the values of the two entry boxes,
#              again as a stub.
#
#   Stage 4: Button works correctly.
#              That is, pressing it causes a robot to move at the speed
#              in the first entry box, for the number of centimeters
#              in the second entry box.
#
#   NOTES:
#     You will have to decide where in your code it is best to construct
#     the robot, and where it is best to do a robot shutdown.
#     Keep in mind that:
#       -- You will eventually use your teammate's connect and
#          disconnect buttons to construct the robot.
#       -- That same robot will eventually be used throughout the code.
#
#     TEST using the SIMULATOR for now.
#
# Do ALL your work in THIS file.  Do not touch m0!
# You will INTEGRATE work in the NEXT session, using m0 to do so.
